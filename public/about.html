<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a web deveoper that enjoys learing about all areas of information technology and is willing to go above and beyond to become the best at any job role that I work for. I enjoy watching soccer and riding a motorcycle.</p>

<p>After high school I joined the army for 3 years which has helped me stay motivated. After the military I thought about what career field I would enjoy and technology at the top of the list. I got my degree in Information Technology while working full-time at Walmart and Chick-fil-A Supply. </p>

<p>My favorite sports team at the moment is Manchester City who won the champions league, league cup, and FA Cup. This is a huge achievement for football becasue it shows that the team was able to compete with every team they faced.</p>
